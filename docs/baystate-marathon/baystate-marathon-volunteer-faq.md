We will have a cross-band repeater in operation for this event. It will be in Chelmsford. Program your radio for it using a SIMPLEX frequency of `446.025` and a PL of `74.4`. It is repeating what it hears and transmits it on the `BAYSTATE1` frequency. If you transmit on the `446.025` PL `74.4` frequency, you will be heard on `BAYSTATE1`. This crossband function may assist to on the course locations to communicate with us at the UCC located at the foot of the Rourke Bridge. **THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO TSONGAS CIRCLE LOCATIONS!**

## What sort of radio do I need?

You ONLY Need an HT. A 5 watt HT should be sufficient. Bring extra battery packs just in case. Some of you may be able to operate out of your vehicle, check out the options once you check in with the water stop team and see what the parking situation looks like.

## What else should I bring with me?

Bring your own food, drink, and camp/collapsible chair. I would recommend you bring a clipboard with the "tracking" form we have used in the past. Don't forget a writing utensil.

## Where can I park?

### If you are stationed at Tsongas

Those at the Tsongas need to arrive early so you can navigate the traffic barriers and get in to the volunteer parking lots. If for some reason you cannot get to the volunteer lot and end up paying at one of the spectator lots, keep your receipt and I'll reimburse you after the race. If you printed out the orange dashboard placard I've emailed or you picked one up at the Family Info table, you should be parking for FREE at the Lot B or Lot C.

### If you are stationed along the course

???

## Where can I pick up volunteer vests?

- **Tsongas Circle locations** â€“ The Family Info table should have orange volunteer vests. Feel free to bring your own if you have one. Please return them to him at the Family Info table when you are clearing from your participation. Most of you at the Tsongas Circle area will be winding down between 2 and 3 PM. Remember you need to be parked and in the vicinity by 6:30 AM because roads will be shut down by 7 AM. Park in Lot B or C. See the attached.

- **Water stop and course volunteers** - If you need vests and orange placards, please stop at the foot of the Rourke Bridge in the Bowlero parking lot ([647 Pawtucket Blvd, Lowell MA 01854](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TTf5UuE5KQY6Htxo9)) and pick them up. We will be there from 6:30 AM on.

## When should I arrive?

Those at the Tsongas need to arrive by 6:30 AM so you can navigate the traffic barriers and get in to the volunteer parking lots.

Course volunteers, please plan on being at your location at least 20-30 minutes before race start. Check in with the water stop team "lead" at your location when you arrive.

## When do I leave?

Your operational period will depend on when the last of the runners have cleared your position. We will advise the location of the end of race/sweep vehicle is when we know its location.

Approximate runner location information is shown on Page 32 of the provided public safety plan. There is a "sweep" vehicle that will be in the proximity of the last runner's. NCS will pass that information along as we have it towards the end of the race.
